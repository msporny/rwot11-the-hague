# Abstract

This work will focus on how a party or its agent can decide whether or not to engage with a counterparty in a transaction. This document first does a survey of prior art related to trust frameworks and technologies to collect the current state of the art. It then extracts requirements from each of these works. It discusses the work at two levels; governance and then technical solution. It then attempts to summarize one or more data models that can support the requirements. The paper then proposes one or more serializations for the data model(s), including but not limited to Verifiable Credentials, DNSSEC, and blockchain-based serializations, that could then be incubated and sent onto the standards track at global standards setting organizations.
